# Architecture Overview

## Decentralized Cloud Storage Platform

### Components
1. **Blockchain**: Manages distributed ledger and data integrity.
2. **Client**: User interface for interacting with the cloud storage.
3. **Networking**: Handles peer-to-peer (P2P) communication.
4. **Utilities**: Provides logging, configuration, and error handling.

### Workflow
1. **Initialization**: Client connects to the network and syncs with the blockchain.
2. **File Operations**: Files are encrypted, split, and distributed across peers.
3. **Retrieval**: Files are retrieved from multiple peers and reassembled.

### Technologies
- C++ for core functionality
- P2P networking for decentralization
- Blockchain for data integrity
- End-to-end encryption for security
